{"name":"The Parliament Project","tagline":"Extracting semantic information from the Greek Parliament archives : an experimentation project","body":"# The Parliament Project\r\n\r\nThis webpage describes the Greek Parliament project, an attempt to provide indexed information about events regarding the greek parliament and its conferences. It accomplishes that by converting the parliament transcripts from raw text (.txt .doc or .pdf) to [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/). \r\n\r\nFor visualization and hosting, [SayIt](http://greek-parliament.sayit.mysociety.org/) and [PopIt]\r\n(https://greekparliament.popit.mysociety.org/) is be used. \r\n\r\nThe project is still in development. Attached are some sample original, some converted files and a (very outdated) project report. Keep your eyes open here and on http://greek-parliament.sayit.mysociety.org for updates. We expect at least all the transcripts between 2012 and 2015 to be properly up before election day (Jan 25).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
